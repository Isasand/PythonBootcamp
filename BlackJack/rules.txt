RULES:

Each player starts by placing a bet in the boxes in front of them.
The size of the bet is chosen by selecting a marker of the amount you want to bet.
The minimum and maximum bet is shown on the table.

Start of round:
Each player gets two open cards, at the same time the dealer recieves
an open card(European) or two open cards (Atlantic City).

Each turn: 
You can ask for a card to increase the value of your hand.
After you've taken the required number of cards, 
the dealer will complete his hand.
The goal is to get a better hand than the dealer,
it should be higher without the total value exceeding 21.
You can win if the dealer hand is bigger than 21, 
you'll be 'bust' if you get over 21.
(being bust means losing your bet!)

Cards:
A king, queen or jack is worth 10.
Ace is either one or eleven.
When an ace is valued at 11, the higher total is called a 'soft' total. 
Player with a 'soft' hand can either take a card or double 
without the risk of being bust.

Black jack:
Black jack = one ace + one card worth ten (ten, jack, queen, king).
Black jack must be your first two cards and the hand is unbeatable, 
however it could end even if the dealer also gets black jack.

Options available after drawn card:
Split, double, give up or stay.


If you try to do any of the following, the program will issue a warning
and ask you to double check if your action was aware:

	*Take card if total value of hand is 17 or higher
	*Stay if total value of hand is 11 or below
	*Double if total value of hand is 12 or higher
